# Example using [typst-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-typst)

Using the action at `.github/workflows/build.yml`, file `main.typ` is compiled using [lvignoli/typst-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-typst) to a PDF, which is uploaded as an artifact in the action workflow and released, for a tagged commit, with the build timestamp.
